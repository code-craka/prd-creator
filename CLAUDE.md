## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React functional components with hooks
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Write tests for critical business logic

### Database Operations

- Always use transactions for multi-table operations
- Include proper indexes for query performance
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Run migrations in separate commits

### Frontend Patterns

- Use React Context for global state (auth, teams)
- Implement loading and error states for all async operations
- Follow Tailwind CSS utility-first approach
- Use Lucide React for consistent iconography

### Security Considerations

- Validate all user inputs server-side
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Use HTTPS in production
- Sanitize data before database operations
- Implement proper CORS configuration

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Testing

- Unit tests for services and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Database transaction testing
- Authentication and authorization testing

### Frontend Testing

- Component unit tests with React Testing Library
- Hook testing for custom hooks
- Integration tests for user workflows
- Accessibility testing

## Deployment Configuration

### Docker Setup

- Multi-stage builds for production optimization
- Separate containers for backend, frontend, database
- Environment-specific configurations
- Health checks and logging

### Production Considerations

- Database connection pooling
- Redis for session management and caching
- File upload handling with cloud storage
- Error monitoring and logging
- Performance monitoring

## Recent Changes and Context

### Latest Sprint (Team Workspace Foundation)

- Implemented basic team creation and member invitation system
- Added team-scoped PRD sharing functionality
- Created team switcher UI component
- Built team PRD library with filtering capabilities
- Established permission system for team operations

### Current Focus

The project is transitioning from individual PRD creation to collaborative team workspaces. The immediate priority is completing member management features and enhancing the team collaboration experience.

### Next Priorities

1. Complete member management (role changes, removal)
2. Team settings and customization
3. Public PRD sharing and template gallery
4. Stripe integration for monetization
5. Real-time collaboration features
