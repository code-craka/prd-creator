# Member Role Management Implementation

## Overview

The PRD Creator application now includes comprehensive member role management functionality that allows team owners to change member roles between admin and member, and remove team members from workspaces. This feature provides granular control over team permissions and membership.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Backend Implementation

#### 1. **Role Management Endpoints**
- `PUT /teams/:teamId/members/:memberId/role` - Update member role
- `DELETE /teams/:teamId/members/:memberId` - Remove team member
- Comprehensive validation with Joi schemas
- Permission-based access control

#### 2. **Permission System**
- **Owners**: Can change any member's role (admin ↔ member) and remove any member except other owners
- **Admins**: Can remove regular members but cannot change roles or remove other admins
- **Members**: Cannot manage other members

#### 3. **Security Features**
- Users cannot change their own role or remove themselves
- Owner role cannot be changed or removed (except through ownership transfer)
- Activity logging for all role changes and member removals
- Audit trail with reasons and timestamps

#### 4. **Data Integrity**
- Soft deletion of members (marked as inactive vs. hard delete)
- Automatic team switching when removed from current team
- Transaction-based operations for consistency

### ✅ Frontend Implementation

#### 1. **TeamMembersManager Component**
- Tabbed interface for Members, Invitations, and Activity
- Real-time data fetching with React Query
- Permission-based UI rendering
- Integrated modals for role changes and member removal

#### 2. **Role Change Modal**
- Visual role selector with descriptions
- Optional reason field for audit trail
- Confirmation warnings for privilege changes
- Loading states and error handling

#### 3. **Member Removal Modal**
- Confirmation dialog with member details
- Member statistics (join date, PRD count)
- Optional reason field
- Irreversible action warnings

#### 4. **MemberCard Component**
- Rich member information display
- Role badges with appropriate colors and icons
- Activity statistics (join date, last active, PRD count)
- Context menu for role management actions
- Permission-based action visibility

### ✅ Permission Logic

#### Role Hierarchy
```
Owner > Admin > Member
```

#### Permission Matrix
| Action | Owner | Admin | Member |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| Change member → admin | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Change admin → member | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Remove member | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Remove admin | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Remove owner | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### ✅ User Experience Features

#### 1. **Visual Feedback**
- Role badges with distinct colors (Owner: Gold, Admin: Blue, Member: Gray)
- Status indicators for active/inactive members
- Loading spinners during operations
- Toast notifications for success/error states

#### 2. **Smart UI Behavior**
- Actions hidden for insufficient permissions
- Self-management prevention (can't change own role/remove self)
- Contextual warnings for privilege changes
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

#### 3. **Activity Tracking**
- Real-time activity feed showing member management actions
- Role change history with reasons and timestamps
- Searchable and filterable activity logs

## API Endpoints

### Update Member Role
```http
PUT /teams/:teamId/members/:memberId/role
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "role": "admin" | "member",
  "reason": "Optional reason for the change"
}
```

**Permissions**: Only team owners

### Remove Team Member
```http
DELETE /teams/:teamId/members/:memberId
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "reason": "Optional reason for removal"
}
```

**Permissions**: Owners can remove anyone except other owners, Admins can remove members

### Get Team Members
```http
GET /teams/:teamId/members
```

Returns enhanced member data including activity statistics and role information.

## Database Schema

### Enhanced Tables
- `team_members` - Core membership with roles and activity tracking
- `member_activity_logs` - Audit trail for all member actions
- `role_change_history` - Dedicated tracking for role changes

### Key Fields
- `is_active` - Soft deletion flag for removed members
- `deactivated_at` - Timestamp of member removal
- `deactivated_by` - User ID who removed the member
- `last_active_at` - Track member engagement

## Security Considerations

### 1. **Access Control**
- Server-side permission validation on every request
- Role-based endpoint restrictions
- User context verification (can't act on behalf of others)

### 2. **Audit Trail**
- Complete logging of all member management actions
- Reason tracking for accountability
- Immutable activity logs for compliance

### 3. **Data Protection**
- Soft deletion to maintain data integrity
- Historical data preservation for audit purposes
- Graceful handling of team ownership scenarios

## Usage Examples

### Changing a Member to Admin
1. Owner navigates to Team Members section
2. Clicks three-dot menu on member card
3. Selects "Change Role"
4. Chooses "Admin" role and optionally adds reason
5. Confirms change - member gains admin privileges

### Removing a Team Member
1. Owner/Admin navigates to Team Members section
2. Clicks three-dot menu on member card (permissions apply)
3. Selects "Remove Member"
4. Reviews member details and impact
5. Optionally adds removal reason
6. Confirms removal - member loses team access

### Activity Monitoring
1. Navigate to Activity tab in Team Members
2. View chronological log of all member actions
3. Filter by action type or user
4. Export activity reports for compliance

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
- **Insufficient Permissions**: Clear error messages about required permissions
- **Self-Management**: Prevention with helpful explanations
- **Owner Protection**: Cannot remove or change owner role
- **Network Errors**: Retry mechanisms and offline indicators
- **Validation Errors**: Field-specific error messages

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. **Data Fetching**
- React Query for intelligent caching and background updates
- Optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
- Parallel queries for member data and statistics

### 2. **UI Rendering**
- Conditional rendering based on permissions
- Lazy loading of modals and heavy components
- Efficient list rendering for large teams

### 3. **Network Efficiency**
- Batched queries for related data
- Smart cache invalidation strategies
- Minimal payload sizes with targeted updates

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple members for batch role changes
2. **Role Templates**: Predefined permission sets for different use cases
3. **Temporary Roles**: Time-limited admin access
4. **External Integration**: LDAP/SSO role synchronization
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Team collaboration insights and productivity metrics

## Testing
