## 6. Narrative

**Sarah's Monday Morning**: Sarah opens PRD Creator with a coffee and a vague idea: "We need better user onboarding." She clicks "Create PRD" and the AI wizard asks three simple questions. Within minutes, she has a professional 8-section PRD with user stories, success metrics, and implementation phases. She shares it with her team through the workspace, and by lunch, her engineers have added technical comments and her designer has suggested UX improvements. The real-time collaboration means no more email chains or version conflicts. By Friday, they're building features instead of debating requirements.

**Michael's Team Review**: As an engineering lead, Michael receives a notification that Sarah shared a new PRD. He opens it on his phone during his commute and sees the technical requirements are clear and actionable. During the team standup, he uses the comment system to ask clarifying questions, and Sarah responds immediately. The PRD becomes their single source of truth, eliminating the usual back-and-forth meetings.
